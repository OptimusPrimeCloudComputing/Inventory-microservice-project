## Key Design Decisions

### Unlimited Inventory Capacity

This system is designed for **e-commerce** where there are no physical warehouse capacity constraints:

- Inventory quantities use `BIGINT` 
- No maximum capacity checks or limits
- Supports drop-shipping (null warehouse locations)
- Scalable for high-volume online retail

### Stock Reservation System

The `reserved_quantity` field enables:
- Shopping cart reservations
- Pending order holds
- Accurate available inventory calculation
- Prevention of overselling

### Reorder Management

Automatic reorder alerts help maintain optimal stock levels:
- Configurable `reorder_level` triggers alerts
- Configurable `reorder_quantity` suggests order amounts
- `needs_reorder` flag for easy filtering

### Audit Trail

The `inventory_adjustments` table (in database schema) tracks:
- All quantity changes
- Reasons for adjustments
- Who made the changes
- Timestamps for compliance

## Database Schema

The MySQL schema includes:

- **products**: Core product information
- **inventory**: Stock levels and locations
- **inventory_adjustments**: Full audit history
- **Views**: Convenient queries for common operations
  - `v_products_inventory`: Products with inventory status
  - `v_low_stock_items`: Items needing reorder
  - `v_out_of_stock`: Items with no available stock
  - `v_available_products`: In-stock, active products

See `schema.sql` for complete details.

## Business Rules

1. **SKU Uniqueness**: Each product must have a unique SKU
2. **Inventory One-to-One**: Each product can have only one inventory record
3. **Non-Negative Stock**: Inventory quantities cannot be negative
4. **Reserved <= Total**: Reserved quantity cannot exceed total quantity
5. **Cascade Delete**: Deleting a product requires removing inventory first
6. **Price Validation**: Product prices must be >= 0
